The basic idea of this module is to provide easy access to the list of files located in a single directory.

The current HTML implementation with mod_autoindex is nice, but it lacks one major point, its output has to be additionally parsed.

With this module the list of files is directly JSON encoded and you can very simply implement this into your AJAX web applications.
